##Ingredients:

2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste for spiciness)
1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
Salt to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 pound (about 450 grams) penne or your favorite pasta

##Instructions:

Prepare the Pasta:

Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Make the Arrabbiata Sauce:

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
Add Crushed Tomatoes:

Pour in the crushed tomatoes. Be cautious as the sauce might sizzle a bit.
Stir in salt, dried oregano, dried basil, and sugar (if using).
Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.
Season and Finish:

Season with black pepper and additional salt if needed.
Stir in the chopped fresh parsley. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
Combine Sauce and Pasta:

Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the arrabbiata sauce.
Toss the pasta in the sauce until it's well-coated.
Serve:

Serve the Arrabbiata pasta hot, garnished with extra parsley or grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
