This is my chicken recipes
**Ingredients:**

1 whole chicken (about 3-4 pounds)
Salt and pepper to taste
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 lemon, juiced and zested
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh thyme)
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder

**Instructions:**

- Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C).

- Rinse the chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Place it in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet.

- In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, thyme, paprika, onion powder, salt, and pepper to create a marinade.

- Rub the chicken all over, including under the skin, with the marinade mixture. Make sure to coat the chicken evenly.

- If you have time, let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. If you're short on time, you can proceed to the next step immediately.

- Place the chicken in the preheated oven and roast for about 1 hour or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) and the skin is golden brown and crispy.

- Halfway through the cooking time, baste the chicken with the juices from the bottom of the pan to keep it moist.

- Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before carving.

- Serve the lemon garlic roast chicken with your favorite side dishes, such as roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.

Enjoy your delicious homemade roast chicken!
