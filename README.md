Ingredients:

3 ripe bananas, mashed
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup plain yogurt or sour cream
Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the mashed bananas and vanilla extract.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

Fold in the yogurt or sour cream until the batter is smooth. If you're using nuts, gently fold them into the batter.

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread it evenly.

Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs.

Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

Once cooled, slice and enjoy!

Feel free to customize the recipe to your liking by adding chocolate chips, cinnamon, or other favorite ingredients. Enjoy your homemade banana bread!
