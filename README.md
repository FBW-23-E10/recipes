# Spaghetti Aglio e Olio

## Ingredients:
- 400g spaghetti
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.

2. While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Saut√© until the garlic is golden but not browned, about 2 minutes.

3. Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet, tossing to coat the pasta in the garlic-infused oil. If the pasta seems dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta cooking water.

4. Season the pasta with salt and black pepper to taste. Toss until well combined.

5. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the chopped parsley.

6. Serve the spaghetti aglio e olio in individual plates. Optionally, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
