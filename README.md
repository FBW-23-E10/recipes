Ingredients:

For the Grape Leaves:

1 jar of grape leaves in brine (about 60-80 leaves)
Water for rinsing
For the Filling:

1 cup long-grain white rice, rinsed
1/2 lb ground lamb or beef (optional)
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
1/2 cup pine nuts
1/2 cup currants or chopped raisins
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
For the Sauce:

2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

Prepare the Grape Leaves:

Rinse the grape leaves thoroughly under cold water to remove excess salt.
Gently separate the leaves, being careful not to tear them. If using jarred leaves, they might be stacked tightly, so take your time to separate them.
Prepare the Filling:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the rinsed rice, ground meat (if using), chopped onion, tomatoes, pine nuts, currants or raisins, mint, dill, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.
Rolling the Dolma:

Place a grape leaf on a flat surface, shiny side down, and remove the stem if still attached.
Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of the leaf (the amount may vary depending on the size of the leaf). Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from the bottom to the top, creating a cigar-shaped roll. Repeat until all filling is used.
Cooking the Dolma:

In a large pot, arrange the rolled grape leaves snugly, seam side down, to prevent them from unraveling during cooking.
In a bowl, whisk together the broth, lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper to make the sauce. Pour the sauce over the dolma in the pot.
Cooking on the Stovetop:

Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer for about 45-60 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and the grape leaves are tender.
Serve:

Once cooked, let the dolma cool slightly before serving. You can serve them warm or at room temperature. Optionally, garnish with lemon wedges and additional fresh herbs.
Enjoy your homemade dolma!
